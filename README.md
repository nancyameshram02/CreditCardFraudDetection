# CreditCardFraudDetection
This is a Machine Learning project which detects the credit cards as fraudulant or non-fraudulant and also predicts the accuracy of the model used

The important thing to note in this project is:  Credit card dataset is highly imbalanced because there will be more legitimate
transaction when compared with a fraudulent one..

To balance the dataset we use the smoteen library which balances our dataset.
